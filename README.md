This repository contains the API service for the Todo app, which utilizes gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) for efficient communication between the client and the server. gRPC is a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework that allows for seamless interaction between microservices.

How It Works
gRPC Basics
gRPC Protocol: gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as its interface definition language, which enables the definition of services and the messages they send and receive.
Client-Server Architecture: The Todo app consists of a gRPC client that sends requests to the gRPC server, which processes the requests and returns the responses.
Components
Proto Files:

The API definitions are specified in .proto files located in the proto directory. These files define the service methods and message types used in communication.
Service Implementation:

The server implements the defined gRPC service methods (e.g., PostTodo, GetTodos) in the TodoService class. These methods handle the business logic for creating and retrieving todo items.
Client Communication:

The gRPC client in the Todo app communicates with the server using the methods defined in the proto files. It sends serialized messages and receives responses.
Example Workflow
Posting a Todo:

The client calls the PostTodo method, sending a PostTodoDTO message containing the todo item details.
The server processes the request and returns the created Todo item.
Retrieving Todos:

The client calls the GetTodos method to fetch all todo items.
The server responds with a list of Todos, which the client can then display.
Benefits of Using gRPC
Efficiency: gRPC uses HTTP/2 for transport, allowing for multiplexing and efficient use of resources.
Strongly Typed Interfaces: Protobuf provides a strongly typed schema, reducing errors related to message formatting.
Cross-Language Support: gRPC can be used across various programming languages, making it suitable for polyglot microservice architectures.
